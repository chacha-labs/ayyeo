/**
 * Canonical Canonry provider IDs.
 *
 * Every provider anywhere in the system — sweep adapters, Aero agent
 * backends, config keys, CLI flags, API responses — identifies itself by
 * one of these strings. Split by capability:
 *
 * - `SweepProviderIds`  — adapters that can run answer-visibility sweeps.
 *   Perplexity is an answer engine; `local` is an OpenAI-compatible local
 *   LLM; `cdp:chatgpt` is a browser-automation adapter.
 * - `AgentProviderIds`  — LLM backends that can drive the Aero conversation
 *   loop (tool-calling + streaming). Subset of ProviderIds plus `zai` and
 *   `deepinfra` (both agent-only, no sweep adapter).
 *
 * Agent-side code maps these to pi-ai's vendor names (e.g. `claude` →
 * pi-ai's `anthropic`) inside `packages/canonry/src/agent/providers.ts`.
 * `deepinfra` is an OpenAI-compatible host with no pi-ai catalog entry —
 * the agent registry constructs a custom `openai-completions` model pointed
 * at its base URL. External consumers only see the canonical IDs here.

/**
 * Capability tier describing what an LLM call needs. Used by the
 * per-provider model selector so each feature picks an
 * appropriately-tiered model without hand-coding model names at every
 * call site.
 *
 * - `agent`    — multi-step tool use, long context, premium models
 *                (Aero's conversation loop). Default → opus-class /
 *                full-quality models per provider.
 * - `analyze`  — single-shot synthesis, structured input → ~1k tokens
 *                out (explain-this-recommendation, content brief
 *                generation). Default → mid-tier models (sonnet, mini,
 *                flash) — 5-10× cheaper than `agent` with comparable
 *                quality on structured tasks.
 * - `classify` — single-shot yes/no or short structured judgments
 *                (semantic page-coverage match, domain classification).
 *                Default → cheapest fast models (haiku, flash). 50-100×
 *                cheaper than `agent`.
 *
 * Capabilities are intentionally orthogonal to provider selection: a
 * caller declares its capability, the project's configured provider
 * decides which actual model fills that capability.
 *
 * Adding a new capability requires updating the per-provider mapping in
 * `packages/canonry/src/agent/providers.ts` → `PROVIDER_MODELS` and
 * the test `agent/providers.test.ts → "every provider declares every
 * capability"`.

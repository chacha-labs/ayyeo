# contracts

## Purpose

Shared DTOs, enums, Zod schemas, error codes, config validation, and **generic utilities** — the type and helper backbone of the monorepo. Every package imports from here. Never define shared types or generic helpers in consuming packages — see the "Shared Utilities" section in the root `AGENTS.md`.

## Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/errors.ts` | `AppError` class, `ErrorCode` union (27 codes), factory functions, and `describeError` — the shared way to render a caught `unknown` as text. Prefer it over `err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)` everywhere: that `String()` branch renders a thrown plain object as `[object Object]`, and `@typescript-eslint/no-base-to-string` only catches it where the value is typed `unknown`. `describeError` keeps the Error and string paths identical, reports null/undefined as `'unknown error'`, JSON-serializes anything else, and never throws. Note the one place it must NOT be used: `integration-cloudflare-worker`'s generated Worker source is a template literal, so a call there would compile to a reference the edge bundle cannot resolve. |
| `src/log-redaction.ts` | Pure bounded redaction for structured runtime values and diagnostic strings. Shared by console/Fastify logging and durable storage; masks full cookie headers, URL keys and spaced secret labels, drops opaque escaped secret assignments, and avoids unsafe object getters and request/body graphs. |
| `src/operational-logs.ts` | Strict runtime-event, query, and page DTOs. Identity and time filters, sanitized messages, retention policy, and loss counters are the same across REST, CLI, and MCP. Runtime logs are not business audit history. |
| `src/telemetry.ts` | Telemetry DTOs and `normalizeTelemetryStatus`: shared legacy-response normalization and anonymous-ID masking for API hosts, ApiClient/MCP, and CLI output. |
| `src/provider.ts` | `ProviderName`, `ProviderConfig`, `ProviderAdapter` interface |
| `src/project.ts` | Project DTOs and Zod schemas |
| `src/run.ts` | Run and grounding source types |
| `src/simple-measurement-definition.ts` | Frozen inputs for simple runs: identity, exact queries, query classes, location, and requested models. The builder uses the shared classifier. Unknown classification stays null. Canonical serialization preserves exact values and sorts set-like collections. |
| `src/snapshot.ts` | Snapshot DTOs and diff types |
| `src/research.ts` | Research DTOs and shared helpers for exact-text deduplication and declared template bindings/expansion. |
| `src/scopes.ts` | Shared read-only classification (`read` or named `*.read`, unless explicitly write-granted), restricted write grants (`research.run` and Ads), and delegated-consent intersection. Adding an action grant must keep API gates and MCP catalogs aligned. |
| `src/query-tracking.ts` | Shared workspace, assignment preview, and commit DTOs. Tokens bind the exact mutation and workspace. Workload counts belong to the API. |
| `src/visibility-report.ts` | Frozen result selection, independent query-class populations, rates, trends, paginated answers, and competitor provenance. Plain request schema supports MCP JSON Schema. `populations[].comparison`: change since the previous eligible whole-project sweep, with the delta invariant enforced in the response refine. `visibilityReportScopeErrorDetailsSchema` / `parseVisibilityReportScopeErrorDetails`: typed retired-scope details; `retired-market` always pairs with kind `market`. |
| `src/config-schema.ts` | Config file Zod validation |
| `src/models.ts` | Shared model types |
| `src/model-pointers.ts` | Hand-maintained record of dates on which a provider changed the model behind a moving id (`chat-latest` and friends), plus `evaluateModelPointerExposure` (did a change land while the project was running that id?) and `buildModelChangeNotice` (the plain-language caveat both the dashboard and the CLI render — the ONLY wording of it; the DTO carries facts, never prose). Add a new dated entry to `MODEL_POINTER_EVENTS` whenever the provider's changelog announces one, AND move `MODEL_POINTER_REGISTRY_CHECKED_THROUGH` to the day you re-read the sources — every disclosure states that date, so a stale one reads as knowledge we do not have. |
| `src/analytics.ts` | Analytics response DTOs, plus the shared query-window resolvers. `parseWindow` REJECTS an unrecognised window (it used to fall back to `all`, so `--window 60d` returned every row ever stored under the label the caller asked for, a wrong number with no signal attached). `resolveDateRange({ startDate, endDate, window })` folds explicit inclusive `YYYY-MM-DD` bounds and the rolling window into one range: explicit dates win, the window only supplies a cutoff when no `startDate` was given, both boundaries are validated as real calendar dates (a TEXT `date` column would compare `2026-02-30` without complaint), and `explicitDates` tells a caller whether a precomputed per-window rollup can answer the request. |
| `src/formatting.ts` | Generic formatters: `formatRatio`, `formatNumber`, `formatDate`, `formatIsoDate`, `formatIsoDateInTimeZone` (`YYYY-MM-DD` as observed in a named zone, for dates that must line up with a third party that buckets by ITS local day; degrades to the UTC date on a bad zone), `startOfDayHourInTimeZone` (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH` for where a calendar day STARTS on a named zone's wall clock: hour 00 except on the one day a year a zone that springs forward at midnight skips it, so a range boundary never names a wall-clock hour the zone never had; degrades to hour 00), `startOfNextDayHourInTimeZone` (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH` for where the NEXT calendar day starts, i.e. the EXCLUSIVE upper edge that contains the whole of a given day: use it to say where a local day ENDS, such as whether a bucket falls wholly inside a window; NOT as the upper edge of a live request over the day in progress, which is by definition in the future and which a third party may refuse outright rather than clamp, as the OpenAI Ads insights API does with `400: time_ranges.end cannot be in the future`; a calendar step, not +24h, so the 23-hour and 25-hour local days land right), `isoDateDaysBeforeInTimeZone` (the calendar date N CALENDAR days before the date an instant falls on in a named zone — use it for EVERY "N days back" boundary that is a calendar date, because subtracting N × 24h from the instant is not calendar arithmetic: a spring-forward local day is 23 hours and a fall-back one is 25, so the fixed step lands a day off around a transition and the window gains or loses a date), `inclusiveDayCount` (calendar days a `YYYY-MM-DD` range covers counting BOTH ends, on UTC midnights so no daylight-saving transition can move it — the unit a window is LABELLED in, so an off-by-one turns a "30 days" label into a claim the numbers do not support; `null` for a malformed or inverted range, since a `0` would read as a real, empty window), `formatDateRange` |
| `src/index-coverage.ts` | `deriveIndexCoverage` — per-page index state from search-analytics impressions, falling back to URL Inspection. Impressions prove indexing for free at any site size; their absence proves nothing, so an unmeasured page is `unknown` rather than `not-indexed`. |
| `src/url-normalize.ts` | Canonical host extraction, Public Suffix List-aware domain identity, exact-or-subdomain matching, and prose-domain extraction |
| `src/brand-matching.ts` | Unicode-aware exact matching for approved brand aliases across case, spacing, and punctuation presentation variants; never fuzzy metric attribution |
| `src/report-dedup.ts` | Report action / opportunity dedup utilities |
| `src/retry.ts` | Generic retry helpers: `backoffDelayMs`, `withRetry`, `isRetryableHttpError`, `isRateLimitError`, `retryAfterDelayMs`. Used by every API provider, GA4, GBP, and Bing — domain-specific code only supplies the `isRetryable` predicate; the math (jittered exponential backoff per Google's documented formula) lives here. **Rate limiting is detected semantically, not by status code**: a service may report a throttle on a 4xx (Bing answers `400` with `ErrorCode 5 ThrottleHost`), so `isRateLimitError` checks `Retry-After`, then 429, then documented throttle markers in the message. A new integration whose throttle signal is a private numeric code must surface that code's meaning in the error message or set `retryAfter`, or the shared predicate cannot see it. |
| `src/concurrency.ts` | `mapWithConcurrency` — generic order-preserving bounded worker pool (fail-fast on the first rejection, in-flight tasks settle cleanly). Used by the discovery probe phase. |
| `src/http-status.ts` | `LOCATION_REDIRECT_STATUSES` / `isLocationRedirectStatus` — the five statuses that mean "fetch a different URL" (301/302/303/307/308). Deliberately NOT all of 3xx: a 304 is a served page view from cache, so classing it as a redirect drops real visits. Shared by the AI-referral landed/hop split and the sitemap fetcher. |
| `src/index.ts` | Barrel re-export of all modules |

## Patterns

### Adding a new error code

1. Add the code to the `ErrorCode` union in `src/errors.ts`.
2. Create a factory function that returns a new `AppError` with the correct status code:
   ```typescript
   export function myNewError(message: string) {
     return new AppError('MY_NEW_ERROR', message, 422)
   }
   ```
3. The global error handler in `packages/api-routes` will serialize it automatically.

### Adding a new DTO

1. Define the TypeScript interface and optional Zod schema in the appropriate domain file.
2. Re-export from `src/index.ts` (barrel export).
3. Use the DTO in both API routes (request/response validation) and the ApiClient (typed returns).

### Adding a generic utility

1. Pick the right home: `formatting.ts` for formatters, `url-normalize.ts` for URL helpers, `report-dedup.ts` for dedup logic. Create a new topic file (e.g. `parsing.ts`, `time.ts`) when no existing file fits.
2. Keep it pure — no side effects, no I/O, no logging, no DB. Take values, return values.
3. Re-export from `src/index.ts`.
4. Add a test file in `test/<topic>.test.ts` with happy path + edge cases (empty input, invalid input, boundary values).
5. Migrate any inline duplicates you discover in the same change — don't leave duplication for "later."

#### Where utilities live

| Concern | File |
|---------|------|
| Date / number / ratio formatting | `packages/contracts/src/formatting.ts` |
| URL / domain identity | `packages/contracts/src/url-normalize.ts` (`hostOf`, PSL-aware `registrableDomain` / `brandLabelFromDomain`, exact-or-subdomain matching, prose domain extraction) |
| Markdown answer text and links | `packages/contracts/src/markdown-answer.ts` (`readMarkdownAnswer` separates visible text from hidden link destinations) |
| Brand identity matching | `packages/contracts/src/brand-matching.ts` (exact approved aliases across case/spacing/punctuation variants; never fuzzy/edit-distance matching for metrics) |
| Tracked-query text normalization | `packages/contracts/src/query-normalize.ts` (`normalizeQueryText` — trim + lowercase for dedup / FK-null text matching) |
| Report action / opportunity dedup | `packages/contracts/src/report-dedup.ts` |
| Error factories, and rendering a caught `unknown` | `packages/contracts/src/errors.ts` (`describeError` — the one way to turn a `catch` binding into text; never hand-write `err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)`, whose `String()` branch prints `[object Object]` for a thrown object) |
| SQL `LIKE` wildcard escaping | `packages/contracts/src/sql-like.ts` (`escapeLikePattern` — caller adds `ESCAPE '\\'`) |
| Retry / exponential backoff | `packages/contracts/src/retry.ts` (`withRetry`, `backoffDelayMs`, `isRetryableHttpError`) |
| Statistics over a series | `packages/contracts/src/statistics.ts` (`wilsonInterval` for a proportion; `linearTrend` for the least-squares fit of any evenly-spaced series, returning slope-per-step plus the two endpoints a chart draws between). Fit trends server-side and put them in the DTO — a regression computed in a chart component is invisible to the CLI and breaks UI/CLI parity. |
| Bounded async concurrency | `packages/contracts/src/concurrency.ts` (`mapWithConcurrency` — order-preserving worker pool, fail-fast with clean settle) |
| Telemetry funnel classification | `packages/contracts/src/telemetry.ts` (`isGhostTelemetryEvent` — shared by the CLI client drop + the cloud collector backstop) |
| JSON column parsing (DB-only) | `packages/db` (`parseJsonColumn`) |

Add new utility files to `packages/contracts/src/` and re-export them from `index.ts`. Keep modules small and focused — a `formatting.ts` for formatters, a separate file for the next category. One file per concern.

#### Anti-patterns

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong — defining a generic helper inline in a domain file
// packages/api-routes/src/report-renderer.ts
function formatNumber(value: number): string {
  if (Math.abs(value) >= 1_000) return `${(value / 1_000).toFixed(1)}K`
  return value.toLocaleString('en-US')
}

// ✅ Correct — single source of truth, imported everywhere
// packages/contracts/src/formatting.ts
export function formatNumber(value: number): string { /* ... */ }

// packages/api-routes/src/report-renderer.ts
import { formatNumber } from '@ainyc/canonry-contracts'
```

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong — three packages each define their own formatDate
// packages/canonry/src/gsc-sync.ts: function formatDate(d: Date) { ... }
// packages/integration-google-analytics/src/ga4-client.ts: function formatDate(d: Date) { ... }
// packages/api-routes/src/report-renderer.ts: function formatDate(iso: string) { ... }

// ✅ Correct — one shared helper, imported by all three
// packages/contracts/src/formatting.ts: export function formatIsoDate(iso: string) { ... }
```

### Enum constants

| Constant | Type | Values |
|----------|------|--------|
| `RunKinds` | `RunKind` | `RunKinds['answer-visibility']`, `RunKinds['gsc-sync']`, etc. |
| `RunStatuses` | `RunStatus` | `RunStatuses.completed`, `RunStatuses.failed`, etc. |
| `RunTriggers` | `RunTrigger` | `RunTriggers.manual`, `RunTriggers.scheduled`, `RunTriggers.probe`, etc. |
| `CitationStates` | `CitationState` | `CitationStates.cited`, `CitationStates['not-cited']` |
| `VisibilityStates` | `VisibilityState` | `VisibilityStates.visible`, `VisibilityStates['not-visible']` |
| `ComputedTransitions` | `ComputedTransition` | `ComputedTransitions.lost`, `ComputedTransitions.emerging`, etc. |

```typescript
import type { RunKind } from '@ainyc/canonry-contracts'
import { RunKinds, RunStatuses } from '@ainyc/canonry-contracts'

// ✅ Correct — enum constant + typed parameter + exhaustive switch
function kindLabel(kind: RunKind): string {
  switch (kind) {
    case RunKinds['answer-visibility']: return 'Answer visibility sweep'
    case RunKinds['gsc-sync']: return 'GSC sync'
    case RunKinds['inspect-sitemap']: return 'Sitemap inspection'
    case RunKinds['site-audit']: return 'Site audit'
  }
}

// ❌ Wrong — raw string literals, untyped parameter
function kindLabel(kind: string): string {
  switch (kind) {
    case 'answer-visibility': return 'Answer visibility sweep'
    default: return kind
  }
}
```

### Third-party HTTP calls

**Every integration that talks to a third party over HTTP must back off when that service pushes back.** Wrap the package's HTTP layer in `withRetry` from `@ainyc/canonry-contracts` — one private `fetchOnce`, one exported wrapper — so retry is the default rather than something each call site remembers. `packages/integration-bing/src/bing-client.ts` is the reference shape.

#### Rules

1. **Retry is a property of the client, not the caller.** If a call site can forget it, it will.
2. **Do not write a status-code check by hand.** Use `isRetryableHttpError`, which retries rate limiting, 5xx, and network errors, and refuses auth/validation/not-found.
3. **Rate limiting is not always HTTP 429.** A service may report a throttle on a 4xx, or a 200, with the condition in the body — Bing answers `400` with `{"ErrorCode":5,"Message":"ERROR!!! ThrottleHost"}`. `isRateLimitError` therefore tests semantically: `Retry-After`, then 429, then documented throttle markers in the message. If a service signals throttling through a private numeric code, surface that code's meaning in the error message or set `retryAfter` on the error, or the shared predicate cannot see it (see `BingApiError`).
4. **Honour `Retry-After`.** Pass `computeDelayMs: (_a, err, defaultMs) => retryAfterDelayMs(err) ?? defaultMs`. Backing off 1s against a limiter asking for 60 just burns the remaining attempts.
5. **Tune the base delay to the service.** The 1s default is for one-off blips. A service that throttles a burst needs a base above the window it throttles over — Bing uses 2s doubling to a 30s ceiling.
6. **Test both directions.** A retry test that only proves "transient failure eventually succeeds" is half a test. Also assert that auth and validation failures are *not* retried — retrying a permanent failure multiplies load for nothing.

`packages/contracts/test/integration-retry-coverage.test.ts` enforces this: a new HTTP-calling integration without `withRetry` fails CI. Packages that predate the rule are listed there explicitly, and the list may only shrink.

### Market selection

`visibility-report` accepts `marketKey` as an exact refinement of project, group, or property scope. Market scope already selects a market and rejects an additional `marketKey`. Optional scope/query `marketKeys` and `selection.market` carry frozen memberships to consumers. A reporting market may declare `groupKey` only when that group contains every target in its usage edges.

### Competitor model comparisons

`competitorLandscapeQuerySchema` accepts optional `groupBy: model` and an exact
requested `model` filter. A model filter requires `provider`. The optional
`modelComparison` response groups stored evidence by provider and requested
model, with independent counts and denominators. Null model identity remains
unknown. `servedModels` carries separate upstream evidence. Never substitute
requested identity for missing served identity. Existing aggregate responses
remain valid without these optional fields. Pins remain project/market identities,
not model-specific records. The same contract covers Simple and Advanced scopes.

### Error factory functions

Always use factory functions — never hand-construct error JSON:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct
throw validationError('"queries" must be non-empty')
throw notFound(`Project "${name}" not found`)

// ❌ Wrong
return reply.status(400).send({ error: { code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR', message: '...' } })
```

Available factories: `validationError()`, `notFound()`, `alreadyExists()`, `authRequired()`, `forbidden()`, `providerError()`, `quotaExceeded()`, `configError()`, `internalError()`.

## Common Mistakes

- **Hand-constructing error JSON** — always use factory functions from `errors.ts`.
- **Defining shared types in consuming packages** — types used across packages belong here.
- **Defining generic helpers (formatters, parsers, normalizers) inline in consumer files** — they belong in this package. See "Shared Utilities" in the root `AGENTS.md`.
- **Forgetting to re-export from `index.ts`** — consumers import from `@ainyc/canonry-contracts`.
- **Creating Zod schema without corresponding TypeScript type** — keep them paired.

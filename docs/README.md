# Canonry Docs Index

Start here when you need to understand what is implemented today and how it fits together.

Canonry is API-first. The API is the source of truth, the CLI is the standard operator surface, and the web UI is a secondary consumer for human analysts.

## Implementation Records

| Document | Label | Audience | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`oss-onboarding-evaluation.md`](oss-onboarding-evaluation.md) | implemented | product, design, engineers | Source-based evaluation and decisions for the OSS onboarding rework |

New plans, product direction, and design rationale live in PR descriptions.
The implementation record above preserves context, but it does not define
current behavior. Durable behavior rules live in the per-package `AGENTS.md`
files.

## Reading Order

1. Read [`README.md`](../README.md) for product context and quickstart.
2. Read [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) for the current shape of the system.
3. Use the provider, deployment, and testing docs for current implementation details.
